      longDescription: "Dental implants are a revolutionary way to replace missing teeth. An implant is a small titanium post that is surgically placed into the jawbone where teeth are missing. These metal anchors act as tooth root substitutes. The bone bonds with the titanium, creating a strong foundation for artificial teeth. Implants can help preserve facial structure, preventing bone deterioration that occurs when teeth are missing.",
