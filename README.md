# Relax Dental Services - Front-End Assignment

This project is a simplified redesign of a Dental website, built as part of a front-end web development assignment. It showcases proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS (with Axios for data handling), along with responsive and accessible design practices.

## Features

*   **Four Key Pages:**
    *   Home Page: Hero section, clinic introduction, services overview, FAQ, and CTA.
    *   About Us Page: Clinic background, practitioner details, and mission statement.
    *   Services Page: A list of dental services with descriptions (click for more details via modal).
    *   Contact Us Page: Contact form (simulated submission with Axios), contact information, and an embedded Google Map.
*   **Common Components:** Reusable Header, Footer, and FAQ accordion.
*   **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to work on various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
*   **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with React (functional components and hooks), React Router for navigation, and Axios for asynchronous requests.
*   **Custom Styling:** Styled with CSS Modules for component-scoped styles and global CSS for a clean, professional look.
*   **Basic Form Validation:** The contact form includes client-side validation.
*   **Accessibility Considerations:** Semantic HTML and ARIA attributes (where appropriate) have been used.

## Technical Requirements Met

*   **ReactJS (Functional Components & Hooks):** Implemented throughout the application.
*   **Routing:** `react-router-dom` used for page navigation.
*   **Axios:** Used for simulating contact form submission.
*   **Styling:** Custom CSS using CSS Modules.
*   **Responsiveness:** Media queries are used for adapting layout to different devices.
*   **Form Validation:** Basic client-side validation on the contact form.
*   **Folder Structure:** Follows React best practices for organization.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v14 or later recommended)
*   npm (usually comes with Node.js) or Yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/dental-website.git 
    cd dental-website
    ```
    *(Replace `https://github.com/your-username/dental-website.git` with the actual repository URL)*

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or using Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the development server:**
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    Or using Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```
    This will open the application in your default web browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production

To create a production build:
Using npm:
```bash
npm run build
```
Or using Yarn:
```bash
yarn build
```
This will create an optimized `build` folder in the project directory.

## Technologies Used

*   React.js (v18)
*   React Router DOM (v6)
*   Axios
*   CSS Modules
*   HTML5
*   JavaScript (ES6+)
